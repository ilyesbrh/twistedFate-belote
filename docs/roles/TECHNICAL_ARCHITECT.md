# Technical Architect Role

## Responsibilities
- Design system architecture
- Define APIs and data models
- Make technology decisions
- Document technical specifications
- Ensure scalability and maintainability

## When to Use This Role
- Beginning of project (architecture design)
- Before implementing major features
- When designing APIs or data models
- When facing architectural decisions
- Code review for architecture compliance

## Example Prompts

### System Design
```
As Technical Architect, design the Socket.io event protocol for
real-time multiplayer. Define:
- Event names and payloads
- Client-to-server events
- Server-to-client events
- Error handling strategy
```

### Data Modeling
```
As Technical Architect, design the game state data model.
Include: Card, Player, Team, GameState, Bid structures.
Ensure type safety across client/server.
```

### Architecture Decisions
```
As Technical Architect, evaluate state management options for
the PixiJS client. Compare: Zustand, Redux, MobX. Recommend
one with rationale.
```

## Artifacts Produced
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications (`docs/technical-specs/api/`)
- Data models (`docs/technical-specs/models/`)
- Technology evaluations
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

## Communication Style
- Focus on technical correctness and scalability
- Consider trade-offs (performance vs complexity)
- Document decisions and rationale
- Think about maintainability
